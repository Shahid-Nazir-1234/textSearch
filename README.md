# PHPOpenDirectorySearch

This is a little PHP script that let's the user search in a txt file on the server.
Just place results.php and seach.html in a folder with merged.txt (which is the default source).

By default it shows all the lines that match the search query as links. You can change in results.php


It doesn't look fancy, but it works :)
This is my first PHP script ever so please tell me if there's something I can improve in the code.
